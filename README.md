Description:
Welcome to the "Message App" project! This is an application that allows users 
to communicate with each other in real time. This project is developed to learn 
more about designing and creating more engaging applications.

Database Configuration:
MySQL Community Edition is the freely downloadable version of the world's most 
popular open source database. It is available under the GPL license and is 
supported by a huge and active community of open source developers. You must 
set the right parameters in Message-App/Server/src/app/Settings.java 
(SQL_DB_USERNAME, SQL_DB_USER_PASSWORD). To create database, use script
in Message-App/Server/assets/sql/create_db.sql.

Server Configuration:
Set the port number in the Message-App/Server/src/app/Settings.java (API_PORT).
Configure the database as per the section above.

Client Configuration:
Set the server port number and IP address in the Message-App/Client/src/app/api/Client.java
(API_SERVER_PORT, API_SERVER_IP_ADDRESS).

First run:
1. Configure client and server, then generate two JAR files of each application and
move them to the root directory.
2. Start the server using the Server/run.bat.
3. Run the client app by JAR file.
4. Enjoy using the app.
